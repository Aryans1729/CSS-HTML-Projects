            <b>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) </b> was a
            charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken
            murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took
            part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative
            Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of
            sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
            household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age
            23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas
            from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in
            India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the
            Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful
            campaign for India's independence.
